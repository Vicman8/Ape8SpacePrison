    dialogueText: Hey, ever noticed how a simple bar of soap can be more than just
      for cleaning?
    responses:
    - responseText: Yeah, like how you can carve shapes into it to pass the time.
      nextNode:
        dialogueText: Exactly! And if you're skilled enough, you can even carve something
          useful, like a makeshift key.
        responses:
        - responseText: Yeah, I've heard about that. They say it takes patience and
            a steady hand.
          nextNode:
            dialogueText: Indeed, it does. Crafting a key from soap requires precision,
              but it's a skill worth mastering.

            start?
          nextNode:
            dialogueText: Ah, it all starts with a keen eye and a sharp blade. I
              could show you sometime if you're interested.

      nextNode:
        dialogueText: Exactly, my friend! With a bit of ingenuity, that bar of soap
          can become a tool for freedom. Ever heard of molding a key from soap and
          using a knife to carve it into shape?
        responses:
        - responseText: Huh, never tried that before. But it makes sense, I guess.
          nextNode:
            dialogueText: Glad you find it intriguing! It's amazing what you can
              learn when you're stuck in here.

            a lot about this stuff, Victor

              instincts kick in, you know?'
