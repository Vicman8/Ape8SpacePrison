    dialogueText: Hey, have you seen my tentacle arm? I seem to have misplaced it.
    responses:
    - responseText: Your tentacle arm? No, but I heard a rumor that there's a black
        market for alien body parts around here.
      nextNode:
        dialogueText: A black market? That's absurd! My appendages are not for sale,
          especially not to these lowlifes.
        responses:
        - responseText: I didn't mean to offend. Just trying to help. Let's focus
            on finding your arm.
          nextNode:
            dialogueText: I appreciate your concern. Let's indeed focus on the task
              at hand.

        - responseText: Sorry, didn't mean to suggest anything like that. Let's keep
            searching, maybe it's just misplaced.
          nextNode:
            dialogueText: No worries. Let's continue searching. It has to be around
              here somewhere.

    - responseText: I haven't seen it, but maybe it's a sign of your species evolving
        into something new.
      nextNode:
        dialogueText: Evolving? Huh, that's an interesting thought. I'll have to
          ask my species' biologist about that, but for now, I just want to find
          my arm
        responses:
        - responseText: Yeah, sorry, that was insensitive of me. Let's forget I mentioned
            it and concentrate on locating your arm.
          nextNode:
            dialogueText: It's alright, mistakes happen. Let's just focus on finding
              my arm.

        - responseText: 'Fair enough. Let''s keep our minds on the task at hand:
            finding that missing arm of yours.'
          nextNode:
            dialogueText: Hmm, interesting idea. Let's focus on finding my arm first,
              then we can experiment with any strange substances we come across.
              Maybe we can put my tentacle with a strange slime substance or something.
