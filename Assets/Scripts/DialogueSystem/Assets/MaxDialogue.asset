    dialogueText: Oh, you mean that weird green slime cup? Yeah, I saw it too, but
      I have no clue where it came from.
    responses:
    - responseText: Do you think it's some kind of experiment gone wrong?
      nextNode:
        dialogueText: Could be, but I'm not risking a taste test to find out.
        responses:
        - responseText: Maybe it's a new secret recipe the kitchen staff are experimenting
            with, or maybe they're just trying to gross us out.
          nextNode:
            dialogueText: Interesting theory. If it's a new recipe, I hope they don't
              plan on serving it at mealtime.
            responses:
            - responseText: Yeah, last time they introduced a 'new recipe,' half
                the block was sick for a week. I'm not taking any chances.

            - responseText: Well, if it's anything like the usual prison food, it's
                probably best to stay away from it regardless.
              nextNode:
                dialogueText: Good point. I'll pass on the green slime surprise,
                  thanks. Maybe we can trade it for something useful, though.

        - responseText: I heard it's some kind of extraterrestrial artifact the guards
            found during a routine spacewalk, but they're keeping it hush-hush.
          nextNode:
            dialogueText: Extraterrestrial artifact? Now that's intriguing. If that's
              true, we might be onto something bigger than we thought. We should
              find a way to get a closer look without getting caught.
            responses:
            - responseText: An extraterrestrial artifact? That sounds like the plot
                of one of those old sci-fi vids. But hey, stranger things have happened
              nextNode:
                dialogueText: True, but this is space prison. Stranger things are
                  practically the norm. Let's see if we can turn this into an advantage
                  somehow.

            - responseText: If it's true, we might be in for a wild ride. Let's tread
                carefully, though. We don't want to end up on the wrong side of the
                guards or worse, the aliens.
              nextNode:
                dialogueText: Agreed. We'll need to be cautious. Let's keep this
                  between us for now. Who knows what kind of trouble it could stir
                  up if word gets out.

    - responseText: I heard rumors it's from the aliens in Sector 7, trying to communicate
        with us.
      nextNode:
        dialogueText: Aliens, huh? That's not as far-fetched as it sounds, considering
          where we are. Still, I'd rather not jump to conclusions until we have more
          info.
